While I can't physically execute the development of the website for you, I can guide you step-by-step and provide all the necessary resources, code snippets, and tools to help you or your team complete the project as quickly as possible. Let’s break this down into actionable steps so you can start immediately.

---

### **Immediate Action Plan**

#### **Step 1: Set Up the Project**
1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Initialize a new repository for the project.
   - Use `git init` or create it directly on GitHub.
   - Example: `pranaworld-recreation`.

2. **Choose a Tech Stack**:
   - Frontend: React.js (for dynamic UI).
   - Backend: Node.js with Express (for APIs).
   - Database: MongoDB (for product and user data).
   - AI: Python (for AI models) or pre-built APIs like OpenAI.

3. **Set Up the Development Environment**:
   - Install Node.js, npm, and MongoDB.
   - Install Python if using custom AI models.
   - Use VS Code or any IDE of your choice.

---

#### **Step 2: Create the Basic Structure**
1. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Use `create-react-app` to bootstrap the frontend.
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app pranaworld-frontend
   cd pranaworld-frontend
   npm start
   ```
   - Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install axios react-router-dom tailwindcss
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Initialize a Node.js project:
   ```bash
   mkdir pranaworld-backend
   cd pranaworld-backend
   npm init -y
   npm install express mongoose cors
   ```
   - Create a basic server:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const cors = require('cors');
   const app = express();

   app.use(cors());
   app.use(express.json());

   mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/pranaworld', {
     useNewUrlParser: true,
     useUnifiedTopology: true,
   });

   app.listen(5000, () => {
     console.log('Server is running on port 5000');
   });
   ```

3. **Database Setup**:
   - Install MongoDB locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
   - Define schemas for products, users, and orders.

---

#### **Step 3: Recreate Key Pages**
1. **Homepage**:
   - Create a responsive homepage with a hero section, featured products, and categories.
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

2. **Product Listing Page**:
   - Fetch products from the backend and display them with filters and sorting options.

3. **Product Detail Page**:
   - Show detailed information about each product, including images, descriptions, and reviews.

4. **Cart and Checkout**:
   - Implement a shopping cart and a secure checkout process.

---

#### **Step 4: Integrate AI Features**
1. **AI-Powered Recommendations**:
   - Use a pre-built recommendation system or train a simple model using Python (e.g., collaborative filtering).
   - Example:
   ```python
   from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
   import pandas as pd

   # Sample data
   data = pd.read_csv('user_product_interactions.csv')
   model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5)
   model.fit(data)

   # Get recommendations for a user
   recommendations = model.kneighbors([user_vector])
   ```

2. **Chatbot**:
   - Use OpenAI’s GPT API or Dialogflow for the chatbot.
   - Example:
   ```javascript
   const openai = require('openai');
   openai.apiKey = 'your-api-key';

   app.post('/chat', async (req, res) => {
     const response = await openai.Completion.create({
       prompt: req.body.message,
       max_tokens: 150,
     });
     res.json({ reply: response.choices[0].text });
   });
   ```

3. **Voice Search**:
   - Use Web Speech API for voice search.
   - Example:
   ```javascript
   const recognition = new (window.SpeechRecognition || window.webkitSpeechRecognition)();
   recognition.onresult = (event) => {
     const transcript = event.results[0][0].transcript;
     // Use transcript to search products
   };
   recognition.start();
   ```

---

#### **Step 5: Test and Deploy**
1. **Testing**:
   - Use tools like Jest (for unit testing) and Cypress (for end-to-end testing).
   - Test all features, including AI integrations.

2. **Deployment**:
   - Frontend: Deploy on Vercel or Netlify.
   - Backend: Deploy on Render or AWS.
   - Database: Use MongoDB Atlas for cloud hosting.

---

### **Deliverables**
1. **Frontend**:
   - Homepage, product listing, product detail, cart, and checkout pages.
2. **Backend**:
   - APIs for product management, user authentication, and order processing.
3. **AI Features**:
   - Product recommendations, chatbot, and voice search.

---

### **Estimated Timeline**
- **Day 1-2**: Set up the project and create basic structure.
- **Day 3-5**: Develop frontend pages.
- **Day 6-7**: Implement backend APIs.
- **Day 8-9**: Integrate AI features.
- **Day 10**: Test and deploy.
